Project Overview:

This project focuses on demonstrating practical SQL queries and analytical techniques. It includes scripts that cover data cleaning, transformation, complex joins, subqueries, window functions, and various aggregation methods to extract meaningful information from a dataset. Whether you are learning SQL or looking for examples of analytical queries, this repository can serve as a valuable resource.

Features

Data Querying: Comprehensive SQL queries to retrieve specific data subsets.
Data Transformation: Scripts for cleaning, reformatting, and transforming raw data.
Advanced Joins:
Examples of INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN for combining data from multiple tables.
Aggregation & Reporting: Use of aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN) and GROUP BY clauses to summarize data.
Subqueries & CTEs:
Implementation of subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex query logic.
Window Functions: Demonstrations of ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LAG(), LEAD(), NTILE() and other window functions for advanced analytical tasks.

SQL:
The core language used for all analysis.
Database System: ( MySQL).
